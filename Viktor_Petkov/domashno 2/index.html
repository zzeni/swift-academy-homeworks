            <p>Late? (Clara pops up at Doc's side.) We'll discuss this later. No, we'll discuss this now...late? Thank you for your gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.He's a very strange young man. He's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. (Doc's House) (Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.) Doc?(Doc is inputting the date in the time panel.) That's right, Doc. November 12th 1955. Unbelievable, that old Biff could have chosen that particular date. It could mean that, that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance. Almost as if it were the junction point for the entire space-time continuum. On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence. (The time display changes to JAN 01 1885 12.00AM.) Damn, gotta fix that thing! (He bangs it and it changes back to NOV 12 1955 06.00AM.) All right, time circuits on. What do you mean, time circuits on? Doc, we're not going back now? Yep.</p>

            <p>(George's Backyard) (George is hanging up laundry.) I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.Marty Jr.(o.s) Grandma, can you just shove it in my mouth? (laughs) (o.s) Don't you be a smart ass! Marty Jr.(o.s.) Oh, great, it's the atrocity channel. (Lorraine puts the pizza in a Black and Decker Hydrator.) Hydrate level 4 please. (4 seconds later, she takes the pizza out, and it’s become full size.) Mmm.(Tannen and his gang are riding fast to get into town.) Giddy up, hey, hoot! (Train Station) Ma'am. How far does the 8:00 train go?I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. 1955? (he jerks up in bed just as Loraine turns on the light.) You're my mo…you're my mo…. My name's Lorraine. Lorraine Baines. (She sits down on the opposite bed.)</p>

            <p>Marty! No! no, I'm not feeling all right! I don't understand one damn thing that's going on around here and why nobody can give me a simple straight answer. (He sits down next to her.) Oh, they must have hit you on the head hard this time. (She runs her hand through her son's hair.) Mom, I just want to know one thing. (He holds her hand.) Where's my father? Where's George McFly? Marty! George, your father is in the same place he's been for the past 12 years. (takes a sip) Oak Park Cemetery. (Oak Park Cemetery)He's an absolute dream. (Biff and his friends hop into Biff's car and take off after Marty. They manage to catch up to him. He's on his board right in front of their car. He holds on to the hood since he can't get away.) Ah. Whoa. (Biff spots a manure truck and heads straight for it.) I'm gonna ram him.Ha, ha, ha, yeah! Manure! I hate manure! (Lyon Estates) (The DeLorean flies to the billboard, and Marty lets go of the flag ribbon. He takes his foot off the hoverboard and speaks to Doc over the walkie-talkies.the lightning storm is starting.) (w.t) Doc, is everything all right, over?</p>

            <p>(v.o, on video) How do you feel Mr Tannen? (on video) Third time's the charm. (Biff kisses Lorraine. Marty can't believe it.) No!!! (He steps backwards - into the arms of 3-D, Match and Skinhead. Skinhead grabs Marty.) No! Hey wait, you're coming with us upstairs!What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Who? (points over at Lorraine's table.) Biff. (Biff is sitting at Lorraine's table, and he's trying to grope her.) C'mon, c'mon.Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Right, I got it. Ahh. Doc. (Doc climbs up to the top of the Clock Tower so they can fix the cable.)I'll be able to see my wedding dress. Wow. I wonder where we live, I bet its a big house, with lots of kids. How many kids... (Doc gets out a gadget and shines it on Jennifer. She falls back, unconscious.) Doc, what the hell are you doing?</p>
